# Discontinuation of Fork
I have decided as of May 11th 2022 that I will no longer be upholding this fork of OpenCAD.
Mainly because nobody uses OpenCAD anymore, mainly in favor of Bubble CAD's and whatnot.
I will still be providing support with setting it up, using it, and bug fixing, but there will NOT be any new features or any other major changes.
